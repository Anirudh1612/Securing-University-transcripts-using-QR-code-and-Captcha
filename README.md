# Securing-University-transcripts-using-QR-code-and-Captcha
In an attempt to make universities paperless, students transcripts can be made digital and to increase privacy and security
the transcripts can be encoded in QR code . 
This projects encodes every individual transcript into a corresponding QR code and generates a unique captcha for the same. 
This captcha acts as a key to access the QR code so that only humans can access the transcripts.

The code is implemented for a single PC, if you want to run the encryption and decryption code on different PC you just have to change the 
host ip address in the encryprion code to the ip address of the PC you are running the decryption code and in the decryption code change the server IP address to the address of the PC you are running the encryption code.


To install any of the modules just run "pip install <module-name>" in the command line.
